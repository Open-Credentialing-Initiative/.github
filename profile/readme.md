# üëã Welcome to OCI's GitHub!

The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative industry effort enabling pharmaceutical supply chain actors to establish digital proof of identity, licensure status and information authorship using digital wallets and verifiable credentials.

Publishing on GitHub allows us to not only share important documents but also be transparent about any changes made.

You can find more information about us on [our website](https://www.oc-i.org/) and in our [Getting Started Guide](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/getting-started).
